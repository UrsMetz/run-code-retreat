== Functional Calisthenics

. Side effects can only occur at the top level
. No mutable state
. Expressions not statements
. Functions should have 1 argument
. No explicit recursion
. Maximum type-level abstraction
. Always use infinite sequences
. No "if"
. Name everything
. Use intermediates
. Don't abbreviate
