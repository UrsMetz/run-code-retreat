=== Evolution

. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
